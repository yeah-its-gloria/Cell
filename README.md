# Cell - Rust
This is the Rust tree for Cell.  
This version is currently in an even earlier state than the C++ version.

## Notes
I chose to disable std across the entire project.  
It sucks. Therefore it goes away.

In short, Rust's std fails to provide enough features in a decent fashion for my engine.  
Core serves as a replacement thereof.

Linux support is pretty flakey again. Sorry.
